# ensemble-Species-Distribution-Modeling
Forecasting hotspots of climatic suitability for grassland restoration under climate change in North America

This repository contains R scripts and data files for:
1. **Spatial Thinning for Rarefaction of Occurrence Points** using the `spThin` R package.
2. **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) Analysis** to address multicollinearity among bioclimatic variables.
3. **Ensemble Species Distribution Modeling** for 26 species.

## Repository Structure
- `scripts/`: R scripts for spatial thinning, VIF analysis, and SDM modeling.
- `data/`: Data files, including bioclimatic variable values and input CSV for SDM.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/Spatial-Thinning-and-SDM.git
